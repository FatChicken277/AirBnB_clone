# :feelsgood: AirBnB Clone - Console :japanese_ogre:
This project is the console part of a soon to be fully functional AirBnB clone for the Holberton School academy of coding

## :volcano: Usage
```bash
./console.py # Use this to run the console, after that:
```
```bash
quit # Use this command to quit the console
help <command> # This will display information about the command
create <class> # This will create a new object of the available classes
<class>.<command>(<Optional: id> <Optional: attribute/Dictionary> <Optional: Value>
